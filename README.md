CS & Data Analytics @ Alfred University  

Hi! I'm Mike, a passionate computer science and data analytics student exploring the intersection of technology and problem-solving. I love building projects that combine coding, data, and real-world impact—whether it's analyzing datasets, creating tools to make life easier, or experimenting with new tech.  

Outside of coding, I enjoy mentoring, running, and finding ways to bring communities together through innovative solutions.  

Feel free to explore my repositories to see my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about tech! 🚀
